<a href="https://github.com/openai/gpt-3">GPT3</a> is trained with 175 billion parameters is able to achieve what the authors describe as "meta-learning." Meta-learning means that the GPT neural net is not re-trained to perform a task such as sentence completion. Given an example of a task, such as an incomplete sentence, and then the completed sentence, GPT-3 will proceed to complete any incomplete sentence it's given.  Below are examples of unique implementations using GPT3 or resources to learn about it.
